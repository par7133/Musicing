# Musicing

Hello and welcome to Musicing!<br>
	  
Musicing is a light, simple, software on premise to build and own your music blog.<br>
	   
Musicing is released under GPLv3 license, it is supplied AS-IS and we do not take any responsibility for its misusage.<br>
	   
First step, use the password box and salt fields to create the hash to insert in the config file. Remember to manually set there also the salt value.<br>
	   
As you are going to run Musicing in the PHP process context, using a limited web server or phpfpm user, you must follow some simple directives for an optimal first setup:<br>

<ol>
<li>Check the write permissions of your "data" folder in your web app Private path; and set its path in the config file.</li>
<li>Set the default Locale.</li>
<li>Set FILE_MAX_SIZE (remember that some PHP settings could limit the upload behaviour of Faceborg too)</li>
<li>Set BLOG_MAX_POSTS to limit the number of visible posts in the blog.</li>
<li>Set PAGINATION true or false to give more public access to your data.</li>
</ol> 

Song file nomenclature: "Playlist~Song Title.mp3"
